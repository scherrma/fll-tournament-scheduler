A tool to automatically generate schedules for one-day FIRST Lego League tournaments. Uses an Excel frontend calling a python executable to parse a roster of teams and a variety of scheduling settings, then generates the schedule and exports a workbook presenting half a dozen different views of the schedule - judging based, table based, and team based.

Provides support for divisions segregated into different judging rooms.
